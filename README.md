#  Plotting Assigment

This project focuses on analyzing vehicle and fuel efficiency data using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. The aim is to visualize patterns in transport data, particularly related to COâ‚‚ emissions and fuel usage, as part of a systems-based contribution to the global stocktake initiative.

##  Objectives

- Import and explore a dataset related to vehicles and fuel economy.
- Create **histograms** and a **heatmap** to analyze feature relationships.
- Provide clear **interpretations** of the visualizations for AI-ready insights.
